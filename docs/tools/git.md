# Git

## Getting Started

### Installation

```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt dist-upgrade

sudo apt install git

git --version
git --help
```

### GUI Clients

- [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/)
- [Git source control in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/overview)

_Note:_ personally, I prefer to use the Command-Line Interface (CLI) of git, to
better understand how the workflow of managing git repositories work. Still,
GUI clients can be of great help to visualise the Git branch tree, manage
tags/submodules, while giving a more graphic perspective of the
repositories' state.
