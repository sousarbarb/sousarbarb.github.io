# Tools

The main goal for the existence of this page is to have a personal record of
tools used and/or still using through my life.
Although I have tried to create git repositories to gather some information,
sometimes it may be difficult to maintain several separate repositories of
information and/or code.
Thus, this page is a centralisation of knowledge gained throughout different
academic and professional experiences.
Hope it may be of some use for you.

See the left-side navigation bar to see which tools I have reported in this
website...
