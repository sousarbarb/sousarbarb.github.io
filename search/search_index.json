The OptiOdom calibration algorithm, generalises the odometry calibration problem. It is developed an optimisation-based approach that uses the improved Resilient Propagation without weight-backtracking (iRprop-) for estimating the kinematic parameters using only the position data of the robot. Even though a calibration path is suggested to be used in the calibration procedure, the OptiOdom method is not path-specific. In the experiments performed, the OptiOdom was tested using four different robots on a square, arbitrary, and suggested calibration paths. The OptiTrack motion capture system was used as a ground-truth. Overall, the use of OptiOdom led to improvements in the odometry accuracy (in terms of maximum distance and absolute orientation errors over the path) over the existent literature while being a generalised approach to the odometry calibration problem.

The context of this project was the automotive industry. The VINCI 7D consortium intended to innovate in the industrial process of printing in three-dimensional parts, adopting more automatic and robotic mechanisms, and less dependent on manual processes and mechanical setups. In addition, it was intended to promote the implementation of a technology that allows the innovation of multi-ink printing parts, allowing the creation of sensors and actuators on its surface (e.g., having a car dash with components printed on its surface, instead of mounting and fixing them).</p> <p>The main responsability of INESC TEC was the 2D to 3D projection of electronic circuits and/or decorations. The company Rui Azevedo - Solu\u00e7\u00f5es de Acabamentos e Tampografia established that all electronic circuits and/or decorations should be described by Gerber files (traditionally used in printed circuit boards' industry). Therefore, my main contribution for this project was the development of a Gerber parser compatible with the Gerber X2 standard to convert the text file into a bitmap image (DOI: 10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3187042). This parser implemented a recursive descendent approach to interpret the Gerber commands and, consequently, to generate the parsing tree. The bitmap generation leveraged from the drawing functions available in the OpenCV library. Although the bitmap image could have been used for an inkjet approach to generate both the robotic manipulator trajectories and the pulses for the printing head, the company decided to prefer a plotter-like approach. This decision led to my smaller contribution of developing a second version of the parser to also consider the parametric definitions of the graphical contents described in the Gerber file, to allow the correct generation of the plotter-like trajectories.</p> <p>Link: https://www.inesctec.pt/en/projects/vinci7d</p>"},{"location":"publications/","title":"Publications","text":""},{"location":"publications/#journal-articles","title":"Journal articles","text":"<p>Ribeiro, J.D., Sousa, R.B., Martins, J.G., Aguiar, A.S., Santos, F.N., &amp; Sobreira, H.M.

The course program included programming industrial systems using IEC 61131-3 (using programming languages such as sequential function charts, functional block diagrams), UML modelling, design patterns, and technologies for industrial integration (XML, OPC-UA). In the laboratory classes, the students were required to develop an industrial control system composed by three subsystems: the factory automation level using the Codesys soft-PLC, the Manufacturing Execution System (MES) to schedule the daily production of the factory and supervise the production statistics, and the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) to receive the client orders and compute the long-term sceduling of the production (decouple client orders into parts production, handling suppliers' orders, and dispatch the orders deliveries). Although the communication between PLC and MES was forced to be OPC-UA, the students could choose any other technology and communication protocol between the MES and ERP.</p> <p>My participation in lecturing the laboratory classes of the Industrial Informatics course was mainly on project supervision, helping the students to elaborate the architecture for their industrial control system, while also contributing on small development examples (e.g., usage of OPC-UA with Codesys).</p>"},{"location":"teaching/#software-design-msc-in-ece-feup","title":"Software Design (MSc in ECE @ FEUP)","text":"<p>This course focused on teaching software engineering concepts, methods, and techniques to enable students to apply them in the design and development of software systems.

Any programming language could be used to develop the project, even though we advised the students to use either C++ or Java, in order to guarantee some support in terms of the implementation throughout the development. The expected learning outcomes and competences for the students after finishing the Software Design were the following ones: formulation of a product vision, identification and documentation of a software system's requirements using user stories, UML modelling (use cases, class, sequence, and components diagrams, among others), unit tests, use of version control systems (e.g., Git), project management, and plan, estimation, and management of an agile software development process.</p> <p>My participation in lecturing the laboratory classes of the Software Design course included the following contributions: fully documented examples of how to configure the C++ and Java development environment in Linux and Windows (in the case of C++, using different compilation tools: make, CMake, and even with the JSON tasks of Visual Studio Code), program examples with implementations of GUIs (Qt) and database connection (PostgreSQL), unit test examples using the GTest portable framework, and project supervision during the semester.</p>"},{"location":"tools/","title":"Tools","text":"<p>The main goal for the existence of this page is to have a personal record of tools used and/or still using through my life.
